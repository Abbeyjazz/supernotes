## A Little Dino's Tale

```
A tiny dino, pencil in claw,
Writes his notes without a flaw.
Each thought preserved, each memory bright,
In black and white, so crisp and light.

No fancy features, no complex maze,
Just simple notes for simple days.
He clicks and types with pure delight,
His notepad glowing through the night.

Auto-save keeps his words so safe,
No need to worry, no need to chafe.
First line's the title, clean and neat,
His system simple, his joy complete.

A happy dino, content and free,
With his notes app, as it should be.
🦖
